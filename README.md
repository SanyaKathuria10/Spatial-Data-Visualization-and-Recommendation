# Foursquare NYC Check-In Visualization and Recommendation Engine 
Spatial Temporal Data Mining Project Spring 2018

In this project, we investigate the Foursquare checkins dataset containing 227,428 check-ins in New York city and report an assessment of human mobility patterns by analyzing the spatial and temporal aspects associated with these footprints. We attempt to explore the behaviours of users in New York city and then visualize the dataset to find interesting patterns. We then present a recommender system which suggests a particular set of venues (such as restaurants) to a user and then further also develop a second model for recommending a set of users to a venue, keeping in mind both user-preferences, usersâ€™ location and popularity of the venues.
